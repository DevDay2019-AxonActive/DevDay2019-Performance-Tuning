9,"Amazon.com\r\nScott O'Dell won the Newbery Medal for Island of the Blue Dolphins in 1961, and in 1976 the Children's Literature Association named this riveting story one of the 10 best American children's books of the past 200 years. O'Dell was inspired by the real-life story of a 12-year-old American Indian girl, Karana. The author based his book on the life of this remarkable young woman who, during the evacuation of Ghalas-at (an island off the coast of California), jumped ship to stay with her young brother who had been abandoned on the island. He died shortly thereafter, and Karana fended for herself on the island for 18 years.\r\n\r\nO'Dell tells the miraculous story of how Karana forages on land and in the ocean, clothes herself (in a green-cormorant skirt and an otter cape on special occasions), and secures shelter. Perhaps even more startlingly, she finds strength and serenity living alone on the island. This beautiful edition of Island of the Blue Dolphins is enriched with 12 full-page watercolor paintings by Ted Lewin, illustrator of more than 100 children's books, including Ali, Child of the Desert. A gripping story of battling wild dogs and sea elephants, this simply told, suspenseful tale of survival is also an uplifting adventure of the spirit. (Ages 9 to 12)",,7,claresmom

11,"In the Pacific there is an island that looks like a big fish sunning itself in the sea. Around it, blue dolphins swim, otters play, and sea elephants and sea birds abound. Once, Indians also lived on the island. And when they left and sailed to the east, one young girl was left behind. \r\n\r\nThis is the story of Karana, the Indian girl who lived alone for years on the Island of the Blue Dolphins. Year after year, she watched one season pass into another and waited for a ship to take her away. But while she waited, she kept herself alive by building shelter, making weapons, finding food, and fighting her enemies, the wild dogs. It is not only an unusual adventure of survival, but also a tale of natural beauty and personal discovery.",,7,shfacey
12,"I loved this book very much as a child, read it again as a teen. It sets ones senses to wander...the sensitivity of this writer takes you to places beyond imagining. Adults will also be captivated by this true story of the bravery of a young woman and a life well lived, on an island, alone. I am planning to read my daughter book again very soon, and I don't believe i have ever read any book so happily as this one, knowing how this girls story rewards the soul.",,7,dreamingtikay

The many readers who discovered C.S. Lewis's Chronicles through The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe will be delighted to find that the next volume in the series is actually the first in the sequence--and a step back in time. In this unforgettable story, British schoolchildren Polly and Digory inadvertently tumble into the Wood Between the Worlds, where they meet the evil Queen Jadis and, ultimately, the great, mysterious King Aslan. We witness the birth of Narnia and discover the legendary source of all the adventures that are to follow in the seven books that comprise the series.\r\n\r\nRich, heavy pages, a gold-embossed cover, and Pauline Baynes's original illustrations (hand-colored by the illustrator herself 40 years later) make this special edition of a classic a bona fide treasure. (Ages 9 and older) --Emilie Coulter --This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title.\r\n\r\nFrom AudioFile\r\nWritten in 1955 as a prequel to the 1950 fantasy novel THE LION, THE WITCH, AND THE WARDROBE, this title is the story of two children in Victorian England who unwittingly take part in the (re)birth of the magical land of Narnia. Kenneth Branagh's precise and enchanting reading takes the listener from the rooftops of London to the fields of Narnia, and then back to London as mad Uncle Andrew ushers an evil sorceress named Jadis to wreak havoc in our world. Lewis's storytelling is magnificent, and Branagh's performance completely and utterly engaging. S.E.S.

He was a Fellow and Tutor in English literature at Oxford University until 1954 when he was unanimously elected to the Chair of Medieval and Renaissance English at Cambridge University, a position he held until his retirement. His major contributions in literary criticism, childrens literature, fantasy literature, and popular theology brought him international renown and acclaim. He wrote more than thirty books, allowing him to reach a vast audience, and his works continue to attract thousands of new readers every year. His most distinguished and popular accomplishments include The Chronicles of Narnia, Out of the Silent Planet, The Four Loves, The Screwtape Letters, and Mere Christianity.\r\n\r\nExcerpted from The Magician's Nephew (The Chronicles of Narnia, Book 1) by C.

The dark place was like a long tunnel with brick wall on one side and sloping roof on the other. In the roof there were little chunks of light between the slates. There was no floor in this tunnel: you had to step from rafter to rafter, and between them there was only plaster. If you stepped on this you would find yourself falling through the ceiling of the room below. Polly had used the bit of the tunnel just beside the cistern as a smugglers' cave. She had brought up bits of old packing cases and the seats of broken kitchen chairs, and things of that sort, and spread them across from rafter to rafter so as to make a bit of floor. Here she kept a cash-box containing various treasures, and a story she was writing and usually a few apples. She had often drunk a quiet bottle of ginger-beer in there: the old bottles made it look more like a smugglers' cave.\r\n\r\nDigory quite liked the cave (she wouldn't let him see the story) but he was more interested in exploring.\r\n\r\n""Look here,"" he said. ""How long does this tunnel go on for? I mean, does it stop where your house ends?""\r\n\r\n""No,"" said Polly. ""The walls don't go out to the roof. It goes on. I don't know how far.""\r\n\r\n""Then we could get the length of the whole row of houses.""\r\n\r\n""So we could,"" said Polly. ""And oh, I say!""\r\n\r\n""What?""\r\n\r\n""We could get into the other houses.""\r\n\r\n""Yes, and get taken up for burglars! No thanks.""\r\n\r\n""Don't be so jolly clever. I was thinking of the house beyond yours.""\r\n\r\n""What about it?""\r\n\r\n""Why, it's the empty one. Daddy says it's always been empty since we came here.""\r\n\r\n""I suppose we ought to have a look at it then,"" said Digory. He was a good deal more excited than you'd have thought from the way he spoke. For of course he was thinking, just as you would have been, of all the reasons why the house might have been empty so long. So was Polly. Neither of them said the word ""haunted"". And both felt that once the thing had been suggested, it would be feeble not to do it.\r\n\r\n""Shall we go and try it now?"" said Digory.\r\n\r\n""All right,"" said Polly.\r\n\r\n""Don't if you'd rather not,"" said Digory.\r\n\r\n""I'm game if you are,"" said she.\r\n\r\n""How are we to know we're in the next house but one?""\r\n\r\nThey decided they would have to go out into the box-room and walk across it taking steps as long as the steps from one rafter to the next. That would give them an idea of how many rafters went to a room. Then they would allow about four more for the passage between the two attics in Polly's house, and then the same number for the maid's bedroom as for the box-room. That would give them the length of the house. When they had done that distance twice they would be at the end of Digory's house; any door they came to after that would let them into an attic of the empty house.\r\n\r\n""But I don't expect it's really empty at all,"" said Digory.\r\n\r\n""What do you expect?""\r\n\r\n""I expect someone lives there in secret, only coming in and out at night, with a dark lantern. We shall probably discover a gang of desperate criminals and get a reward. It's all rot to say a house would be empty all those years unless there was some mystery.""\r\n\r\n""Daddy thought it must be the drains,"" said Polly.\r\n\r\n""Pooh! Grown-ups are always thinking of uninteresting explanations,"" said Digory. Now that they were talking by daylight in the attic instead of by candlelight in the Smugglers' Cave it seemed much less likely that the empty house would be haunted.\r\n\r\nWhen they had measured the attic they had to get a pencil and do a sum. They both got different answers to it at first, and even when they agreed I am not sure they got it right. They were in a hurry to start on the exploration.\r\n\r\n""We mustn't make a sound,"" said Polly as they climbed in again behind the cistern. Because it was such an important occasion they took a candle each (Polly had a good store of them in her cave).\r\n\r\nIt was very dark and dusty and draughty and they stepped from rafter to rafter without a word except when they whispered to one another, ""We're opposite your attic now"", or ""This must be halfway through our house"". And neither of them stumbled and the candles didn't go out, and at last they came to where they could see a little door in the brick wall on their right. There was no bolt or handle on this side of it, of course, for the door had been made for getting in, not for getting out; but there was a catch (as there often is on the inside of a cupboard door) which they felt sure they would be able to turn.\r\n\r\n""Shall I?"" said Digory.\r\n\r\n""I'm game if you are,"" said Polly, just as she had said before. Both felt that it was becoming very serious, but neither would draw back. Digory pushed round the catch with some difficulty. The door swung open and the sudden daylight made them blink. Then, with a great shock, they saw that they were looking, not into a deserted attic, but into a furnished room. But it seemed empty enough. It was dead silent. Polly's curiosity got the better of her. She blew out her candle and stepped out into the strange room, making no more noise than a mouse.",,9,claresmom
